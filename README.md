# Preact Rectangles

## Development guide

*This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*

### About
This is a figma plugin intended to export text and color styles in a format compatible with Material UI. 
It seeks to bridge the gap between product design in figma and application in code with MUI by directly transfering styles from between them.
The plugin functions by opening a gui panel with options for generating and distributing typescript code objects with the necessary styling. 
This includes color pallete objects as well as style and style type objets. 
The primary object for accessible use in code is `figmaTypography` which contains text styling attributes including font options and spacing.
The other typography based objects ensure type checking on styling and conformity with `CSSProperties` as well as dictating typography to be included in MUI variants. 

`figmaPalette` holds the coloring properties exported from the figma doc in rgba format along with their associated label.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v14

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```
